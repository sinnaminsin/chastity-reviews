The **CB‑6000** is arguably the device that brought modern chastity mainstream. Launched in the late 2000s, it paired polycarbonate construction with a modular ring system so users could dial in fit at home—no custom sizing required.

> **Typical wear length:** 1–3 days for new wearers, up to a week once you nail hygiene.

## Fit & comfort

* **Ring system:** five base‑ring diameters (37 mm → 50 mm) let you size down gradually.
* **Weight:** 76 g fully assembled—light enough to forget under loose clothing.
* **Ventilation:** two lateral slots and a single tip hole. Adequate for a rinse in the shower but not as breathable as open‑bar designs.

## Hygiene & long‑term wear

Polycarbonate doesn’t absorb odors, but soap film *does* build in the crevices. A toothbrush and warm water once per day keeps it fresh. After 4–5 days straight you’ll notice moisture retention in cooler climates—plan a cleaning break or move to an open cage for >1‑week lockups.

## Authentic vs. fakes

If the clamshell packaging is missing the CB‑X hologram sticker or the case latch is metal, it’s likely a knock‑off. Geometry is usually fine, but the cheaper plastic cracks at the guide pin holes within weeks.

## Who it’s for

* **Beginners** who want a forgiving, lightweight starter cage.
* **Intermediate** users who need something airport‑friendly (no metal).

Not ideal for 24/7 power‑users or those who sweat heavily—consider a steel open‑bar cage for that use‑case.

### Bottom line

> ★★★★☆ *Still one of the best entry‑level devices, but longevity issues and hygiene hassles keep it from a perfect score.*
